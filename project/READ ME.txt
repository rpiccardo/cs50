REBECA PICCARDO

CS50xMiami Project


Like Pset7, my website has a login, logout and register controllers, 
and usernames and passwords are stored in a table called users 
in a mysql database called project.

After login/register, the user has a drop-down menu with names of different 
public agencies in Miami-Dade County. When a name is selected, a table appears 
with all the contact information for that agency.

The two controllers are index.php and search.php and the 
two templates displayed are sidebar.php and main.php.

The data is stored in the pio table in the project.sql database.

The last feature sends a text message to the user with the 
phone number to the agency of their choosing.

Text.php is the controller and text_form.php is the form the user fills out with
their phone number, carrier and select the agency they want the number for.

The end.
